---

`starlight-copy-button` adds an accessible, polished copy button next to each docs page title in Starlight.
Users can copy the full current docs page as Markdown in one click with clear success/error feedback.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have a Starlight website set up.
If you do not have one yet, follow the [Starlight Getting Started guide](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/).

## Installation

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { PackageManagers } from 'starlight-package-managers';

<Steps>

1. Install `starlight-copy-button`:

   <PackageManagers pkg="starlight-copy-button" />

2. Add the plugin to your Starlight [`plugins`](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/configuration/#plugins) config:

   ```diff lang="js"
   // astro.config.mjs
   import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'
   import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
   +import starlightCopyButton from 'starlight-copy-button'

   export default defineConfig({
     integrations: [
       starlight({
         title: 'My Docs',
   +      plugins: [starlightCopyButton()],
       }),
     ],
   })
   ```

3. Start your docs site in dev mode and open any docs page:

   <PackageManagers type="run" args="dev" />

</Steps>

### What gets added automatically

The plugin:

- injects client behavior to copy full page Markdown to the clipboard
- adds `starlight-copy-button/styles.css` to your Starlight `customCss`
- skips pages that use Starlight's hero title layout
